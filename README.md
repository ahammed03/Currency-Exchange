# ExchangeXpert - Your Real-Time Currency Exchange Rate Specialist.

This project demonstrates a Python-based Currency Exchange API wrapper with a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI). The wrapper interacts with the "FIXER API" to fetch real-time exchange rate data for various currencies. The CLI provides users with options to access exchange rates, perform currency conversion, and analyze historical data.

## Features

- **API Interaction:** Utilizes the "FIXER API" to retrieve real-time exchange rate data for multiple currencies.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Offers a user-friendly interface to access various functionalities.
- **User Input Validation:** Validates user inputs to ensure correct usage and enhance user experience.
- **Modular Structure:** Organized into methods for distinct functionalities, promoting code reusability.
- **Data Presentation:** Returns well-formatted data, enhancing readability and user understanding.
- **Error Handling:** Provides informative error messages in case of API failures or invalid inputs.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Follows an object-oriented approach for improved code organization.
